## TLDR

Mole is a micro PaaS that squeezes every bit of power from low-cost VPSes while keeping things simple and scalable. It handles Git-based deployments with systemd, SSH, Podman, and Caddy—minimal fuss required.

## Project Status

Mole is in early development and may require some effort to set up. Most of the CLI is still subject to change.

Currently, I’m focused on improving and testing the CLI. Next, I’ll tackle a more streamlined setup process and a web dashboard for users who prefer not to use SSH.
