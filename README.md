# Git Pull Deployment Server Manager ("micro PaaS") Focused on systemd

## Navigation

- [Installation Guide](/docs/install.md)
- [Graceful Deployment Guide](/docs/graceful_deployment.md)
- [Mole CLI Documentation](/docs/cli/mole.md)

## Prerequisites

### This quickstart guide assumes a freshly provisioned VPS with the following:

- Running a distribution with **systemd** (minimum version 240).
- SSH root access.
- Caddy installed.

**Note**: **Rocky Linux** was chosen due to better support for recent versions of **Podman**. If you'd like to use a different distribution, you may need to adjust the `install` and `enable` commands below.
