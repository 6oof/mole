# Mole project secrets

When a project is successfully added, Mole automatically generates `project secrets` for the project. The secrets available are:

```txt
	EnvFilePath   - Absolute path to the .env file
	RootDirectory - Absolute Path to the project root
	LogDirectory  - Absolute Path to the log directory
	ProjectName   - Project Name given at mole add
	AppKey        - Generated App Key if needed for the app
	PortApp       - Primary port to be used
	PortTwo       - Alternate port if needed
	PortThree     - Alternate port if needed
	DatabaseName  - Database Name if needed
	DatabaseUser  - Database user if needed
	DatabasePass  - Database password if needed
```

## What are they used for?

Secrets have no other internal use but to be injected into the deployment templates.

You can read more about them [here](/docs/deployments.md).

## Where are they stored?

Secrets are stored at: `/home/mole/secrets/#project-name#.json`

While they can easily be edited we strongly recommend not to do so.

They are stored in a json and **are not encrypted**. (We're looking to change this in the future)

## How are they generated?

`EnvFilePath`, `RootDirectory`, and `LogDirectory` are paths these paths are created when a project is added.

`ProjectName` is the name of the project given at `mole add`.

`AppKey` is a randomly generated string. It picks from `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789` and is `32` characters long.

`PortApp`, `PortTwo`, and `PortThree` are generated by `port magic`. There three ports are the first free ports (ports not in use or reserved) starting from `9000`. They are reserved in a `/home/mole/reservedPorts.json` so they stay available.

`DatabaseName`, `DatabaseUser`, and `DatabasePass` are generated by the same process as AppKey but have a prefix and are shorter.
