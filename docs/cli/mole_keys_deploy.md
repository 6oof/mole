## mole keys deploy

Retrieve or create the deploy key for SSH access

### Synopsis

The "deploy" command displays the current deploy key (id_rsa.pub),
used for accessing private repositories securely. 

If no deploy key is found, a new one will be generated automatically 
and saved to the standard SSH key path. This deploy key enables 
secure, automated interactions with external repositories.
