Manage SSH keys for secure server access

### Synopsis

The "keys" command group provides options for managing SSH keys, 
including deploying and authorizing keys for secure server access.

To remove an authorized key, navigate to /home/mole/.ssh and delete the 
relevant entry in the authorized_keys file.

To regenerate the deploy key, navigate to /home/mole/.ssh and delete 
the id_rsa and id_rsa.pub files. This will allow the system to create 
a new deploy key as needed.

### Options

```
  -h, --help   help for keys
```
