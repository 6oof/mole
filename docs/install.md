# Install Mole

## This is a detailed install script for Mole. This should Ideally be performed on a fresh server.

This guide should produce an enviroment that is minimalistic and reasonably secure by default.

### Prerequisites

#### This quicstart guide assumes a freshly provisioned VPS with the following:

- Running a distribution wiht **systemd** (minimum version 240).
- SSH root access.
- Ability to install Caddy
- Ability to reload caddy systemd service without root
- Ability to isntall git
- Ability to isntall Podman

**Note**: **Rocky linux** is recommended for its stability and strong support for server environments as well as support for recent versions of **Podman**. If you'd like to use a different distribution, you may need to some adjustments to the steps below. notes on choosing a different distro can be found on the bottom of this document.

----

### 1. SSH into your newly created VPS as a root user

### 2. Install Mole

#### Step 1: Download and Run the Install Script

Download the installation script and execute it:

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zulubit/mole/main/install.sh
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

Replace `<your-server-ip>` with your server's IP address.

#### Step 2: Verify the Installation

Once logged in as the `mole` user, check that the `mole` CLI is properly installed and accessible:

```bash
mole version
```

You should see the version number of Mole displayed.

#### Step 3: Setup domains

this step is required for Caddy not to fail on start. Make sure you don't setup your domains with root user to avoid permission errors

```bash
su mole
```

```bash
mole domains setup your@email.com
```

```bash
exit
```

### 3. Install Caddy

#### Step 1: Install Caddy - Reverse Proxy to Manage Your Domains

Run the following commands to install Caddy and its dependencies:

```bash
dnf install 'dnf-command(copr)' -y
dnf copr enable @caddy/caddy -y
dnf install caddy -y
```
this domain is used for ssl certificate alerts


#### Step 2: Set permissions

```bash
usermod -aG mole caddy
chmod 750 /home/mole
```

#### Step 3: Enable and Start Caddy API Service

Reload the systemd daemon and enable the Caddy API service:

```bash
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable --now caddy-api
```

### 4. Install Podman

#### Step 1: Install Podman

Run the following command to install Podman:

```bash
dnf copr enable rhcontainerbot/podman-next -y
dnf install podman -y
```

**NOTE: this uses the copr (testing) version of podman to get all features. If this is too bleeding edge for you, only run the second command from the two provided above.**

#### Step 2: Verify the Installation

Check that Podman is installed correctly:

```bash
podman --version
```

### 5. Setting Up a Firewall (firewalld)

To ensure your server is secure, you can set up a firewall using **firewalld**. This will restrict incoming traffic to SSH (port 22), HTTP (port 80), and HTTPS (port 443).

#### Step 1: Install firewalld

```bash
dnf install firewalld
```

#### Step 2: Start and Enable the Firewall

```bash
systemctl start firewalld
systemctl enable firewalld
```

#### Step 3: Configure Allowed Ports

1. Allow SSH (port 22):

   ```bash
   firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=ssh
   ```

2. Allow HTTP (port 80):

   ```bash
   firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=http
   ```

3. Allow HTTPS (port 443):

   ```bash
   firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=https
   ```

#### Step 4: Reload Firewall Rules

```bash
firewall-cmd --reload
```

#### Step 5: Verify Active Firewall Rules

To check if the correct rules are in place:

```bash
firewall-cmd --list-all
```

This should show that SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS (next to services:) are allowed for incoming traffic.

### 6. Install git

```bash
dnf install git
```

## Choosing a different distribution

This guide is optimized for **Rocky Linux** and other **RHEL-based** distros (like **CentOS**, **AlmaLinux**, and **Fedora**). If you'd like to use a different distribution, here are the adjustments youâ€™ll need to make:

### Adjustments for Ubuntu/Debian-based Distros:

- **Package Manager**: Replace `dnf` with `apt` in the installation commands:
  - For example, use `apt install caddy` instead of `dnf install caddy`.
  
- **Firewall**: If using **UFW** instead of `firewalld`, replace `firewall-cmd` commands with UFW commands:
  - `ufw allow ssh`
  - `ufw allow http`
  - `ufw allow https`

- **Podman**: Use the `apt` equivalent for installing Podman:
  - `apt install podman` (or follow [Podman installation for Ubuntu](https://podman.io/getting-started/installation)).

- **Polkit**: On **Ubuntu/Debian-based** systems, **polkit** is typically used differently. You may need to manage permissions via **sudoers** instead of using `polkit` for user access. For example:
  - Edit the `sudoers` file to allow the user to reload Caddy without a password:
    ```bash
    visudo
    ```
    Add this line to the file:
    ```bash
    username ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/systemctl reload caddy
    ```
